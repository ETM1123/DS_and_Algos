# Data Structure and Algorithms 

In this repository we will cover various algorithms and data structures. The purpose of this repo is to track my learning progress and organize the algorithms/data structures for future use. We will motivate each algorithm, by introducing and solving a general problem. We will also include many problems that are commonly asked in interviews.
